  //Variables and Constants

  what is variable ?
    variable is a container that is used to store data values. such as numbers, strings, or objects.

    we have three ways to declare variables
    Let Var Const

    Ex:-
    let name = "Amrit";      // Stores a string
    const pi = 3.14;         // Constant value
    var age = 25;            // Old method


var ‚Üí Purana hai, function scope me kaam karta hai

let ‚Üí Naya aur safe hai, block scope me hota hai

const ‚Üí Constant hai, value change nahi hoti



var is old, function-scoped, allows redeclaration and value change.
let is modern, block-scoped, allows value change but not redeclaration.
const is also block-scoped, but its value cannot be changed or redeclared.

üó®Ô∏è Hindi + English Mix Version:

var purana hai, function scope me kaam karta hai, value aur naam dono change ho sakte hain.
let naya hai, block scope me kaam karta hai, sirf value change ho sakti hai.
const block scope me hota hai, value aur naam dono fix hote hain.

      var x = 10;  // can redeclare & reassign
      let y = 20;  // can reassign, not redeclare
      const z = 30; // can't reassign or redeclare
